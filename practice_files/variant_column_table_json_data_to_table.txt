step1 : CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t_sample(c1 VARIANT);
step2 : insert json into table 
INSERT INTO t_sample(c1 ) select PARSE_JSON('{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "Sampleville",
    "married": false,
    "hobbies": ["reading", "traveling", "programming"],
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main Street",
      "city": "Sample City",
      "postal_code": "12345"
    }
  }');
  
step4 : SELECT c1:name::String AS name FROM t_sample;
		OUTPUT : John
		
step5 : To convert json into table use lateral flattern function. 
			select t.$1:name::string as Name,
			t.$1:age::number as Age,
			t.$1:city::varchar as City,
			t.$1:married::varchar as Married,
			LISTAGG(s.value::VARCHAR, ', ') AS Hobbies,
			t.$1:address.street::VARCHAR AS Street,
			t.$1:address.city::VARCHAR AS Address_City,
			t.$1:address.postal_code::VARCHAR AS Postal_Code

			from t_sample t,
			lateral flatten(t.$1:hobbies) s,
			GROUP BY 
				Name, Age, City, Married, Street, Address_City, Postal_Code;
			;


			OUTPUT
			NAME	AGE	CITY	MARRIED	HOBBIES	STREET	ADDRESS_CITY	POSTAL_CODE
			John	25	Sampleville	false	reading, traveling, programming	123 Main Street	SampleÂ City	12345
